Learn how to create with biology. WIP: survey on the intersection of genomics + machine learning.

Current survey topics:
* Instructions (DNA, RNA)
* Parts of the DNA (regularity motives, gene expressions, etc.)
* Processes (transcription, translation)
* Machines (proteins, types of proteins, enzymes)
    * Properties (toxicity, solubility, heat resistance, inhibition, stability, etc.)
* Pathways
* Cell components (mitochondria, nucleus, etc.)
* Synthesis (plasmid maps)
* Microbes
* Techniques (PCR, imaging, CRISPR, etc.)
* Synthetic biology process (design, build, test)
* Data sources (proteins [uniprot], enzymes, compounds [ZINC], drug repurposing hub, evolutionary multiple sequence alignment (used in alpha fold), ChEMBL, NCATS, PubChem, Drugbank, etc.)
    * ZINC, a library of commercially-available compounds;
    * PubChem, molecules with biological relevance;
    * ChEMBL, molecules with bioactivity data; be
    * DrugBank, approved or experimental therapeutic molecules
* Parts of the process (benchling, cloud labs, etc.)
* Different stages (invivo, insilco, in vitro, etc.)
* Drug discovery process (phases)
* Relevant ML algorithms (GNNs, representation learning (for graph encoding), deep generative models (for graph generation) like GANs, VAEs)
* Experimental evaluation (DELs and Phage display) â€” more info in paper on BBâ€™s paper
* Benchmarks (MOSES)
* Types of interventions once a target is identified:
    * Genetic (CRISPR)
    * Chemical (hit discovery, molecular generation, etc.)
    * Phenotypic SAR
* molecular representations for virtual screening (aka molecular property prediction)
    * Virtual screening is faster than experimental screening (and cheap since itâ€™s all digital)
    * Restricted to commercially available compounds (ex. ZINC library)
* De novo drug design (inverse of virtual screening): directory generate a compound with certain properties
* Both work hand-in-hand (ex. Virtual screening to generate training data where confidence is low)
